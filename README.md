# ML PlayGround for Regression Techniques
ML Playground to understand Linear and Logistic Regression

## Features:
* Simulate linear and logistic regression on toy data
* Vizualize the model learning using optimizers, on a live plot

## input_config.json
* Configuration file to select the Dataset, Regression Technique, Learning Rate, Loss Function, Classification Threshold and similar configurations critical for model selection and hyperparameters
* Select the relevant configuration and then run the ML_PlayGround_Regression.py file

## Future Scope of Work:
* Code Enahncement
* Include Data pre-processing to scale data
* Implement weight initialization techniques
* Include more regression techniques, loss functions, optimizers
* JavaScript UI for the playground
